# Cassandra > Basics > Possible Use Cases

Many big companies are already using Cassandra such as Apple, eBay and Netflix. One of the most common use cases for using Cassandra is to deal with time-series data. This mean storing large amount of data which are sequence of successive events that are related to some subject. For example in ecommerce applications, you can build a recommendation tool using Cassandra by tracking all the user events on the website (product clicks, checkout , likes , etc ) then use these events to create a more personalized experience and increase sales. The high scalability, availability and performance of Cassandra allows for many other use cases such as storing IOT or sensor related events, messaging, logging, and fraud detection.
