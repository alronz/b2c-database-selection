___


Cassandra doesn't support internally full-text search. However it supports creating a custom index. Custom indexes can be created by writing a java class that implements Cassandra abstract class org.apache.cassandra.db.index.SecondaryIndex. There are also some external plugins available for full-text search such as the [Stratioâ€™s Cassandra Lucene Index](https://github.com/Stratio/cassandra-lucene-index).
