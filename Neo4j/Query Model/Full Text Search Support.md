___

Neo4j doesn't provide any internal full-text indexes that can be used to implement a full-text search. However the use of a external index engine such as Apache Lucene full-text index engine is supported. Since it isn't an internal feature, it won't be covered here. For more information about using lucene full-text index, please refer to the [documentations](http://neo4j.com/docs/milestone/indexing-create-advanced.html).
