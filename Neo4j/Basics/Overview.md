# Neo4j > Basics > Overview

Neo4j is one of the most popular NoSQL graph based databases. It is an open-source database that was implemented using Java and Scala programming languages. It is built completely based on the graph property model from the ground up. Neo4j is compliance with the database ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) and supports limited scalability, availability and fault-tolerance options. Therefore it can be used in OLTP production environments. Additionally, Neo4j supports an easy to use declarative, pattern matching query language called Cypher to interact with the stored data.
