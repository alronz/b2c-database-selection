In order to do operations on the values stored in Redis such as add,update, get or remove, a set of commands for each data type are provided. Those commands can be executed on [bulk](link to pipline support section) and a partial [transaction](link to the transaction section) is supported  as will be explained later in details. Executing these commands can be done using the built-in client "redis-cli" or you can use one of the supported [clients](http://redis.io/clients) for many programming languages. Redis has not so long list of commands that can be easily learned in few hours. In the following sections I will explain the popular commands on each data type including "key" commands. For more complete list of all the commands available in Redis, please check [Redis documentation.](http://redis.io/commands).
