Generally many users prefer to choose redis or any other in-memeory database to store their data only when the performnace or the supported data structures used in Redis is necessary. Otherwise they tend to use other database types for data where slower performance is not a problem or when the data is so big to fit in memeory economically. In the other hand, Redis is a high performance database that can be scaled easily to hundreds of gigabytes of data and millions of requests per second. It also provides on-disk persistance and supports very unique data structures which makes it suitable for a variety of applications such as caching, message broker, chat server, session management, distributed lock system ,  queues , logging system , counting stuff , real time analytics, leaderboards, voting system and many other applications.

Redis can be used efficiently on ecommerce applications for cashing, session management and to store shopping cart data. I will explain [later](link to the example section) on details the complete impelementation of a caching, session management and shopping cart services that can be used on any e-commerce B2C application.
