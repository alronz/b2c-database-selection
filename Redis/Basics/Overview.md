# Redis > Basics > Overview

Redis is an extremely fast NoSQL key-value in-memory database which stores data in different useful data structures such as strings, list, sets and sorted sets. Redis is much similar to memcached but with a built-in persistence which means it can keep your data even after server restarts.  In addition, you can use more complex data types to store your data instead of just strings. Redis supports many powerful features like built-in pub/sub, transaction support with optimistic locking and Lua Scripting. Redis is a very good choice if you are looking for a very fast and highly scalable and available data store solution. In the following sections, we are going through most of the features in more details.
