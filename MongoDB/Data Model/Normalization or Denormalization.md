Traditional databases always try to optimise data using normalisation to achieve the most possible storage efficiency. However, most of NoSQL data stores don't think that storage is the most expensive component in nowadays systems. For instance, MongoDB encourage denormalising the data by using the rich document structure it supports. Denormalising data in MongoDB can reduce development complexity and speed time to market as well as increasing performance. In the other hand, MongoDB supports normalised or denormalised models when representing relationships between your data as have been already explained in previous sections.
